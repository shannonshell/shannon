# Issue 22: Fix Ctrl+C killing shannon during subprocess execution

## Goal

Ctrl+C during a running command (e.g. `npm run dev`) should kill only the child
process, not shannon itself. Shannon should return to the prompt.

## Background

When the user presses Ctrl+C, the terminal sends `SIGINT` to the entire
foreground process group. Both the child process and shannon receive the signal.
Shannon should ignore `SIGINT` while a subprocess is running and let only the
child handle it.

This is how bash, zsh, and fish work — the shell ignores `SIGINT` during command
execution and only handles it at the prompt (to cancel input).

### Current behavior

1. User runs `npm run dev` in shannon
2. User presses Ctrl+C
3. Both `npm` AND shannon receive SIGINT
4. Shannon exits — the shell is gone

### Expected behavior

1. User runs `npm run dev` in shannon
2. User presses Ctrl+C
3. `npm` receives SIGINT and exits
4. Shannon returns to the prompt

### Two execution paths

**Wrapper path (bash/fish/zsh):**

`execute_command` in `executor.rs` uses `Command::new(...).status()` which
blocks until the child exits. Shannon needs to ignore SIGINT before spawning the
child and restore it after.

```rust
// Before spawn
unsafe { libc::signal(libc::SIGINT, libc::SIG_IGN); }

let status = Command::new(binary).args(["-c", &wrapper]).status();

// After spawn
unsafe { libc::signal(libc::SIGINT, libc::SIG_DFL); }
```

Or use the `signal-hook` or `nix` crate for a safer API.

**Nushell embedded path:**

`eval_source` runs nushell commands in-process. When the command spawns external
processes (like `npm`), nushell's own signal handling should manage SIGINT. Need
to verify if nushell handles this correctly or if we need to add signal
management around `eval_source` too.

### Platform considerations

- `SIGINT` / `SIG_IGN` are POSIX (macOS and Linux)
- Windows uses a different mechanism (`SetConsoleCtrlHandler`)
- For MVP, POSIX is sufficient (macOS + Linux)
